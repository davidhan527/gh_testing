* 80% of this presentation is shamelessly stolen from points in this video. I spent most of my time here at greenhouse, learning and thinking about how I can take these priniciples and apply them to Greenhouse and that's what I want to share with everyone today

* Basic Idea: Testing the interface as in, testing the incoming message and the side effect. Rather than testing the implementation details which are constantly changing.
* Maximizing coverage with the fewest tests possible

          <h3>Bad tests are:</h3>
            <p>Slow</p>
            <p>Fragile</p>
            <p>Expensive</p>

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
* When I first came to greenhouse, I did not like testing. I saw them on one hand as something very valuable also a necessary evil. But after learning these priniciples and getting accustomed to practicing them I can honestly say that I enjoy testing and actual find writing tests to be fun. Most people hate writing tests, why?
* Bad tests are expensive, it takes up a lot of developmental time both in writing tests and fixing tests that are constantly breaking.
* I don't think anyone would say that there isn't value in tests. Everyone knows theirs value to them, it's just that it's too time consuming and painful to write and fix them.
* It's possible that, through minimal time investment we can create immense value through our tests. If I am able to effectively and efficiently have thorough coverage in the smallest amount of tests possible, then that's great! If I can do that writing tests can actually be enjoyable rather than painful.

* The goal of today's presentation is how can we avoid that all together.

  1. to make tests pleasant to write and
  2. to make them inexpensive

* When we used to write tests before we implemented these principles, testing was difficult and painful, but once we did start following these principles writing tests became much more efficient and pleasant and now I actually find testing fun. Knowing that I can write tests that are minimul and highly effective gives me a lot of assurance and peace of mind about a feature that I'm introducing. This is immensely valuable.

* this test is still redundant.
* Over specification. Adds cost with no benefits
* this only binds you the implementation details of the hiring_manager_name method
* we shouldn't care how the full_name method works, if it changes it's implementation the first test will still pass.
* If a message has no visible public side effects, the sender should not test it. That's the job of the receiving class
* We've been unit testing some things well, but I don't think we're doing this well yet. We should be more mindful of having too many assertions on message sending.
* we should only be testing direct public side effects. The goal is to get the most coverage with the least amount of tests. We don't want tests to be expensive.
* with all that said, break the rule if it saves money during development. Sometimes there are private methods that we don't have the time and luxury to refactor and they need to be tested. In those cases you can use your best judgement and test them if you need to.

* Sometimes you have a method with distant side effects which also requires a lot of setup.
* An object that calls a method on another object which in turn calls on a method on another object.
* Mocking a method like that does not provide assurance that the code will be working.
* Although this individual method may be well tested in the application class, how can I be sure that this method will work in this specific setup in this specific circumstance of the controller? I don't.
* To get around this, .and_call_original allows us to assert that a method will be sent and then actually call the method so that we can make sure that the string of methods that are called through the .hire method does not error out. This provides some extra assurance and provides greater coverage.
